## What dbskill helps you solve

You do not need to learn a complex methodology first, or know which tool to invoke. Give `/dbs` your current business situation, material, decision, or blocker. It decides whether one Skill is sufficient; complex tasks can use one lead Skill and up to two supporting Skills.

| Situation | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| Customers say your offer is expensive | Business diagnosis, risks, and validation actions |
| You have a topic but cannot turn it into watchable content | Content direction, hooks, titles, and script improvements |
| You know what to do but cannot move forward | Analysis of the blocker and one concrete starting action |
| You keep facing similar decisions without accumulating experience | Decision records, patterns, and snapshots |
| Your drafts, topics, and cases are scattered | A maintainable content-asset project |

## Quick start

After installation, enter this in your Agent:

```text
/dbs I run coding classes for children. I have 40 paid students, but renewals are low.
Help me determine whether the issue is the product, pricing, or customer segment.
```

`/dbs` reads the current conversation, explains its selection, and generates a prompt you can send directly. Add new facts or feedback after a round, then call `/dbs` again to reassess the current task.

When you already know the task, call a Skill directly:

```text
/dbs-diagnosis I offer home-organization consulting for mothers. Clients say it is expensive. What should I change?
/dbs-content I want to discuss “ordinary people should not rush into building a personal brand.” How can I turn this into content?
/dbs-hook Here are the first 20 seconds of my video script. Improve the opening: …
/dbs-benchmark I want to study enterprise-service content accounts. Which benchmarks should I research?
```

## Capabilities

| Goal | Main Skills | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluate a business, product, price, or customer | `/dbs-diagnosis` | Diagnosis, risks, validation plan |
| Find and study benchmarks | `/dbs-benchmark` | Benchmark shortlist and research framework |
| Audit an experiential claim and ground it in a credible theory | `/dbs-theory-grounding` | Revised claim, theory anchor, case reinterpretation, and boundaries |
| Check Codex quotas and reset credits | `/dbs-reset` | 5-hour and weekly windows, available credits, expiry, and explicit reset confirmation |
| Ground a problem in relevant fields and theories, then study historical analogies | `/dbs-standard-answer` | Theory anchor, case matrix, conditional answer, and failure boundaries |
| Create topics, content, titles, and videos | `/dbs-content`, `/dbs-hook`, `/dbs-xhs-title` | Direction and publishable copy |
| Extract short-video data and speech transcripts | `/dbs-video-extract` | Work or account data plus Markdown transcripts filed by author and title |
| Check content risks before publishing | `/dbs-content-risk-check` | Machine-review signals, substantive issues, and minimal edits |
| Review resonance, logic, and reach | `/dbs-resonate`, `/dbs-script-flow`, `/dbs-spread` | Prioritized edits |
| Clarify concepts, goals, and questions | `/dbs-deconstruct`, `/dbs-goal`, `/dbs-good-question` | Testable definitions and goals |
| Work through procrastination and execution blocks | `/dbs-action` | Blocker analysis and next action |
| Record and review long-term decisions | `/dbs-decision`, `/dbs-save`, `/dbs-restore`, `/dbs-report` | Local decision archive and reports |
| Build content assets and multi-Agent workflows | `/dbs-content-system`, `/dbs-agent-migration`, `/dbs-install-skill` | Local project, topic map, and installation plan |
| Turn a local folder into a knowledge base | `/dbs-knowledge` | Knowledge navigation, version rules, and ready-to-use prompts |

See the [full guide and Skill directory](docs/新手入门.md#skill-全目录) for all 33 business Skills, examples, and workflows.

## Install

### Recommended: Claude Code, Doubao, WorkBuddy, Codex, and other Agents supporting Skills

Run in a terminal:

```bash
npx -y skills add dontbesilent2025/dbskill -g --all
```

Return to your Agent and enter `/dbs 新手入门` to begin.

### Claude Code marketplace

You can also install the complete toolkit through the Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add dontbesilent2025/dbskill
claude plugin install dbs@dontbesilent-skills
```

The `dbs` plugin includes all 33 public business Skills plus the `dbs-update` system entry. Claude Code namespaces plugin Skills: use `/dbs:dbs` for the main entry and commands such as `/dbs:dbs-diagnosis` for a specific capability.

To install only one capability, choose its marketplace plugin, for example `claude plugin install dbs-diagnosis@dontbesilent-skills`.

### Update

Ask your current Agent:

```text
更新 dbskill
```

This syncs the official dbskill and does not modify records, reports, or decisions under `~/.dbs/`. See the [commit history](https://github.com/dontbesilent2025/dbskill/commits/main) for changes.

## How it works

```text
A real task
   ↓
/dbs reads context and decides between one Skill or a composition
   ↓
It generates a directly usable task prompt
   ↓
The selected Skills deliver one unified result
   ↓
Add results and feedback, then reassess the task
```

## Knowledge base and local records

The repository includes 4,176 structured knowledge atoms, methodology documents organized by Skill, and a high-frequency concept glossary.

- Read the [atom library guide](知识库/原子库/README.md) for data scope and fields.
- Use `知识库/原子库/atoms.jsonl` to build your own RAG.
- Browse the [Skill knowledge packs](知识库/Skill知识包) for the methods.
- Use `/dbs-save`, `/dbs-restore`, and `/dbs-report` for work across conversations. Data stays locally in `~/.dbs/`.
